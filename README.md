These are some impressive data manipulations and analyses you've conducted! Let's delve into addressing each of your recommended analyses:

### 1. Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
To find this, you've already calculated the ROI by subtracting the Funding from the Valuation. Now you can sort the DataFrame by the ROI column to find the companies with the highest ROI.

```python
df_sorted_roi = df.sort_values(by='ROI', ascending=False)
top_roi_companies = df_sorted_roi[['Company', 'ROI']].head(10)
```

### 2. How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way?
You can calculate the duration it took for each company to become a unicorn by subtracting the Year Founded from the Date Joined. Then you can analyze the average duration and see if there's any trend over the years.

```python
from datetime import datetime

df['Date Joined'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date Joined'])
df['Years_to_Unicorn'] = (df['Date Joined'] - pd.to_datetime(df['Year Founded'], format='%Y')).dt.days / 365
average_duration = df['Years_to_Unicorn'].mean()
```

### 3. Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs?
You can group the data by country and city, then count the number of unique companies in each group to find out which countries and cities have the most unicorns.

```python
country_counts = df['Country'].value_counts()
city_counts = df['City'].value_counts()
```

### 4. Which investors have funded the most unicorns?
You can analyze this by splitting the 'Select Investors' column, counting the occurrences of each investor, and then sorting them to find the top investors.

```python
investors = df['Select Investors'].str.split(', ', expand=True).stack().value_counts()
```

By implementing these analyses, you can gain valuable insights into the unicorn landscape and investment dynamics. Let me know if you need further assistance!
